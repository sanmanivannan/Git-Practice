git init
=========
1. git init command is used when a project is started freshly and wanted to be created in the git project
 NOTE: If any project is Cloned or Downloaded from the GITHUB/GITLAB, then the "git init" command may not be used as its already initialized

2. when "git init: command is executed initially during a normal project turning to the git project; a hidded file called .git file is created and placed on the git file

what is inside the .git file and why its important:
-----------------------------------------------------
The . git folder contains all the information that is necessary for your project in version control and all the information about commits, remote repository address, etc. 
All of them are present in this folder. It also contains a log that stores your commit history so that you can roll back to history.

git and github SSH connection setup
====================================
git(local) and the github(remote repo) should always be connected to the seemless connectivity to make the transaction between those 2
For which we need to setup the SSH connectivity between those 2, else eveytime when we try to push/pull data between those 2, we should provide the username and password
Just to avoid those manual process, we need to setup the SSH  connectivity 
NOTE: Do only the SSH setup in your PC or Trusted systems(DONT setup on the PUBLIC PCs)

ssh-keygen


.gitignore
==========

.gitignore is the the hidden file within the GIT repository(which we need to manually create)
Is use to have the librarys, dependencies and other unwanted file which doesnt need need to be git commited
All the files inside the .gitignore file would be omited/ignored while the commits are done
